LaTeX template for generating course syllabi, for use with Pandoc. `memoir-syllabus.latex` thanks to @agoldst

Simplified version of https://github.com/agoldst/memsyll, which uses only one Markdown file that contains all frontmater and contents. See `syllabus.md` for an example file.

Usage:

* move or copy `memoir-syllabus.latex` to ` ~/.pandoc/templates`.
* `syllabus.sh foo.md` will generate `syllabus.pdf` in the working directory.
